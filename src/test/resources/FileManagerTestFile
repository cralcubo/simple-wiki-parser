== This is the place for defining InterWiki prefixes ==

This page was modelled after the MeatBall:InterMapTxt page.
In addition, an optional comment is allowed after the mapping.


This page is interpreted in a special way by Trac, in order to support
!InterWiki links in a flexible and dynamic way.

The code block after the first line separator in this page
will be interpreted as a list of !InterWiki specifications:

{{{
prefix <space> URL [<space> # comment]
}}}
{{{
#!html
<span style="color:#999900"><br/>
The items captions like f.e. "Process Monitor Definitions" wraps, word wrapping is allowed to a maximum of two lines, no additional ellipses is shown. <br/>
Upon resizing and reducing the width, the minimal width should still allow the icon column to be fully seen. <br/>
</span>
}}}

By using `$1`, `$2`, etc. within the URL, it is possible to create
InterWiki links which support multiple arguments, e.g. Trac:ticket:40.
The URL itself can be optionally followed by a comment,
which will subsequently be used for decorating the links
using that prefix.

New !InterWiki links can be created by adding to that list, in real time.
Note however that ''deletions'' are also taken into account immediately,
so it may be better to use comments for disabling prefixes.
